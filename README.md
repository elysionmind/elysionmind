## Hi there! 👋

I'm ElysionMind, a developer passionate about the intersection of code and blockchain consensus. Transitioning from Web2 to Web3, I'm building on Avalanche because it's fast, scalable, and all about real innovation. Documenting my journey and learning in public—join me! Avalanche ftw! 🔺

- 🌐 **Focus**: Web3 dApps, NFTs, and gamified experiences on $AVAX
- 🚀 **Currently Building**: [ChainRoasts](https://x.com/ChainRoasts) – An NFT game where users mint roasts, chain them together, vote on the best burns, and earn rewards. Beta on testnet coming next month! #ComingSoon
- 📚 **Learning**: Solidity smart contracts, referral systems, and Avalanche's subnet magic
- 💬 **Community**: Active in the AVAX ecosystem—hit me up for collabs, beta testers, or just to chat $AVAX vibes

## Featured Project

### ChainRoasts
A fun, community-driven NFT roasting game on Avalanche. Mint your roast, link it to others, vote, and get rewarded for the sharpest takes. Built with security in mind—audits incoming before mainnet.

- **Tech Stack**: Solidity, Avalanche C-Chain, React, Hardhat for testing
- **Status**: In development | Testnet beta soon | Seeking early adopters & volunteers
